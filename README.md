## About The Project

GreenGold started as a passion project during a hackathon, born from a desire to make modern technology accessible and useful for farmers everywhere. Our goal is to empower farmers with a smart, easy-to-use tool that provides real, actionable advice for sustainable and productive agriculture. We believe that by bridging the technology gap, we can help optimize resources, increase crop yields, and promote a healthier planet.

This isn't just an app; it's a partner for your farm. It combines a real-time dashboard of your farm's vital signs with an intelligent chat assistant that's always ready to help.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive AI Chat**: Have a conversation with an AI that understands your farm's live data. Ask questions, get advice, and receive clear, actionable steps.
-   **Visual Plant Health Analysis**: Snap a photo of a plant, and our AI will analyze its health, identify potential issues, and suggest solutions.
-   **All-in-One Farm Dashboard**: See everything at a glance with our comprehensive suite of widgets.
-   **Multi-Language Support**: The interface and AI responses are available in over a dozen languages to support farmers globally.
-   **Clear Data Visuals**: We turn complex data into simple charts and graphs, so you always know what's happening on your farm.
-   **Text-to-Speech**: Listen to the AI's advice, perfect for when you're busy in the field.
-   **Light & Dark Modes**: Choose the theme that works best for your environment.

## The Dashboard at a Glance

Our dashboard provides a live, interactive overview of your farm's key metrics:

-   **Time & Weather**: Personalized greetings based on the time of day and live, simulated weather conditions that affect the entire dashboard.
-   **Irrigation Advisor**: An AI-powered summary that tells you exactly what irrigation action to take (or not take) based on all available data.
-   **Soil Moisture**: A live look at your soil's hydration levels, complete with an interactive irrigation and drainage simulation.
-   **NPK Nutrient Levels**: Track the balance of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K), and simulate fertigation to correct imbalances.
-   **Soil Health**: Monitor Soil pH and Salinity (EC) levels to ensure optimal growing conditions.
-   **Critical Alerts & Recommendations**: Get immediate, AI-driven alerts for urgent issues and proactive recommendations for improving your farm's health.
-   **Farm Analytics**: Visualize your crop distribution, track market price trends for your key crops, and see your positive impact on yield and water savings.
-   **Quick Actions**: Easily access common tasks like logging new data or initiating a soil test.

## Supported Languages

The app is currently available in: English, Hindi, Kannada, Spanish, Portuguese, Bengali, French, Arabic, Mandarin, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, and Korean.

## Built With

-   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI**: Google Gemini API
-   **Charting**: Custom SVG components

## Future Plans

We're always thinking about what's next. Here are some features on our roadmap:

-   **IoT Device Integration**: The ultimate goal is to connect GreenGold to real-world IoT sensors for fully automated, live data tracking from your fields.
-   **Historical Data & Trend Analysis**: Go beyond real-time data to view historical trends for weather, soil conditions, and crop yields.
-   **Expanded Crop Database**: Add a wider variety of crops with specific data models for each.

## Getting Started

Want to run GreenGold on your own machine? Hereâ€™s how.

### Prerequisites

You'll need an API key from Google AI Studio to power the AI features.

### Local Development

This project is set up to run directly in a browser-based development environment that can serve static files and manage environment variables.

1.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Your development environment needs a variable named `API_KEY` set to your valid Gemini API Key. The application is coded to read this key directly.

2.  **Serve the files:**
    Use a simple static file server (like VS Code's Live Server) to serve the `index.html` file from the root directory.

### Deployment

This is a static web application, so you can host it anywhere you like.

1.  **Deploy the project folder** to a static hosting provider such as:
    -   Vercel
    -   Netlify
    -   Firebase Hosting
    -   Google Cloud Storage

2.  **Configure your environment variable**: This is the most important step! In your hosting provider's settings, you must add the `API_KEY` environment variable. The application will not work without it.
